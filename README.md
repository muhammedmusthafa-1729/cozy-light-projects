1. Code names game
   Code names game folder has text file with some words to play the game. Another file to translate a random 25 words from the text file to Malayalam.
   And create_pattern creates the pattern for the game. (google code names)
2. Math buffon's needle problem
   Buffon's needle problem is the following - if there are equidistant parallel lines and a certain number of needles of the same length L less than the distance T between the parallel lines falling randomly on the plane of the parallel lines, then some of these needles will be crossing the parallel lines and some of them will be falling between. The ratio of the number of needles falling touching the parallel lines to number of all needles will be 2*L/(pi*T).
   The code I have written is using this theorem to calculate approximate values of pi. I have defined needles, equidistant lines and angles mathematically to create randomness and to calculate pi. As we calculate with more number of needles, we see that the values converge to actual value of pi.
   I have the code to visualize the plane and fallen needles.
3. Math points in a square
   This came from an absolute random idea. Once I was getting into the lift in my office and it was crowded as always. As people would leave the lift, the rest of the people inside will move aside to make more room for each other. So I thought what if there is a square of a certain side length and what would be the optimal positions of n points in that square to have maximum distance among each other?
   This uses genetic algorithm to calculate this. But it is very inefficient, this was a casual project.
4. Math riffle shuffle
   I wanted to see how a certain number of riffle shuffle of cards creates the same pattern again.
